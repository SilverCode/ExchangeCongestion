# Description
This script parses the report generated by the "mtr" command, takes the average
value of the 2nd hop (so at the exchange) and outputs it in a graph format.

I have configured cron to run mtr every 30 minutes and output the results to
a log file (mtr_report.txt), which this program is then run against. The
data output by this script is in a standard CSV format that can then be used
in a spreadsheet program (LibreOffice Calc) in my case, where I can render
the graph.

# Requirements
PHP cli and MTR
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install php5-cli mtr
```

# Running
NOTE: /tmp/ is used for illustrative purposes. If you want information to
persist across reboots, you should probably use your home folder.

To generate the data, the following is added to crontab to execute the script
every 30 minutes.

```bash
$ crontab -e
```
```
*/30 * * * * /tmp/run_mtr_report
```

Once some data has been generated and placed in _/tmp/mtr_report.txt_, you can
run the php script against it

```bash
$ php -f report.php /tmp/mtr_report.php
```
